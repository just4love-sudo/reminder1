    <h1>The Space Between Calls</h1>
    <p>
It’s not really your silence that’s breaking me.  
It’s what’s in between  
those damn gaps between our calls  
where I sit and overthink  
and remember what your voice used to sound like  
when it still felt warm.  

You’re not here.  
But somehow, I still catch you in echoes  
a dumb joke,  
a sound that’s a little too close to your laugh,  
and suddenly you’re everywhere.  

Your humor?  
God, it’s stupid.  
Not even funny half the time.  
But it still makes me laugh  
because it’s you.  

You don’t have to say you care.  
You never did.  
You’re there  
even in the nothingness,  
the stillness,  
the space where other people would've already walked away.  

You were spring  
in a life that felt like endless grey.  
And even though my brain forgets everything lately  
appointments, passwords, people.  
it doesn’t forget you.  
Your kindness is burned into me.  

You’re strongest  
when you stop pretending.  
When you cry and don’t hide it.  
When you’re fragile and don’t say “I’m fine.”  

You keep yourself locked up,  
like you’re too much for the world.  
But I’ve seen all the parts you hide  
and loved every one of them.  

Now I just sit in this quiet  
and try to convince myself  
that you still think of me  
when the world slows down.  

Because honestly,  
I don’t know how to be okay  
in the space  
between calls.
