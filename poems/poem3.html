    <h1>If You Ever Forgot</h1>
    <p>
If you ever forgot the sound of my voice  
when I wasn’t trying to be strong,  
I hope the wind carries something familiar.  
Something soft.  
Something like me.

If you forgot how I looked at you  
like you were more than just a person,  
I hope your reflection one day reminds you  
that someone once saw  
the whole universe in your eyes.

If you forgot the way we laughed at nothing,  
the late nights,  
the stupid jokes,  
I hope a passing song  
pulls it all back.  
Even just for a moment.

If you forgot how I held you  
without even touching you,  
in words, in silence,  
in the space between texts.  
I hope something aches in you  
the way I did.

If you forgot me,  
not out of anger,  
but because life just moves on..  
know that I remembered enough  
for both of us.

And if one day  
the memory comes back  
like a whisper,  
like a dream,  
I hope it feels warm.

Because it was real.  
It was always real.
