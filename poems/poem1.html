    <h1>The Day She Left</h1>
    <p>
The day I left,
I realized she was special.
But the day she left 
that’s when I learned what losing a soul feels like.

She doesn’t have to say “I love you” to make me feel it.
Even her silence speaks in soft echoes.
a kind of care too quiet for the world to hear,
but loud enough for my heart.

Her humor is stupid.
Silly.
Brainrot-tier.
And yet, somehow, it makes me laugh in the way nothing else does.
Like spring flowers blooming on tired soil.
She is spring.

I forget things even recent ones.
But not her.
Never her.
Her personality, her kindness.
those live where memory fails.

I wish I could take her pain,
fold it into paper.
and let the wind carry it far from her.

She is strongest when she’s honest,
when she doesn’t try to fake her smile.
And she is most fragile
when she hides it all behind pretending.
I see her.
Even when she tries not to be seen.

She hides her emotions
like delicate letters she doesn’t want anyone to read.
But I’d open every envelope just to understand her better.

She completes me.
Not in a movie kind of way
in the quiet, real way.
The “you make life feel bearable” kind of way.

I don’t know what makes our bond this strong.
But it just is.
And if she’s not here...
How am I supposed to survive?
