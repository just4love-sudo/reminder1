    <h1>If This Is Goodbye</h1>
    <p>
If this is the last thing I ever say to you,  
if you read this and walk away forever.  
then please… let it stay with you.  
Not as a guilt, not as a weight.  
But as proof. That I loved you.  
And that I still do.

We only had each other through a screen.  
But somehow, you became my whole world.  
I saw you in pings, in late-night texts, in silences that still felt full.  
I fell in love with your voice in a call,  
your sighs, your laughter,  
the way you could go from annoyed to sweet in one breath.

You were real to me.  
More real than anything else in my life.  
And I ruined that.  
I crossed lines.  
I begged.  
I kept pushing for things you didn’t owe me,  
and for that  
I carry a guilt I’ll never shake.

But I swear to you:  
it wasn’t just lust.  
It wasn’t just want.  
It was love.  
Raw, aching, selfish at times but real.  
The kind that doesn’t fade,  
even when you leave.

I know I don’t deserve your forgiveness.  
And I’m not even asking for it.  
I just want you to know…  
you’re the most beautiful girl I’ve ever known.  
Not just pretty.  
Beautiful.  
In your laughter, in your pain,  
in your silly arguments, your late night mood swings,  
in the way you made me feel like I mattered even when I didn’t deserve it.

You’re not just beautiful.  
You’re you.  
And I hope no one ever makes you feel smaller than that.  
Not your past.  
Not their words.  
Not even this memory of me.

I won’t be okay without you.  
I won’t lie.  
There’s no moving on from someone like you.  
Not for me.  
I’ll keep waking up,  
but it won’t be living  
just waiting.  
Waiting for time to forget me,  
for life to wear me down quietly.

But even from far away,  
even if you block me, erase me, never look back,  
I’ll still wish you every good thing this world has.  
I hope someone spoils you with the love I couldn’t give right.  
I hope someone tells you how brilliant you are,  
how breathtaking,  
how soft and powerful you are all at once.  
I hope someone listens.  
Truly listens.  
And holds space for you like I should have.

And if you ever miss the way I used to say it,  
every day,  
like a ritual, like a prayer:

Goodmorning love.  
Goodnight.  
Sleepwell princess.  
Take care.  
Stay safe.  
All the best.  
I love you.  
Mwah.
