    <h1>A Letter I Never Sent</h1>
    <p>Hey,</p>
    <p>I don’t know where things stand anymore between us, within you, within me. Maybe you’ve moved on quietly. Maybe you're still holding on in ways you don’t speak about. Either way, I’m not here to ask for anything.</p>

    <p>I made this because sometimes love doesn’t need a destination. It just needs somewhere to rest. A place to leave behind what was felt, what was real, and what words couldn’t say out loud.</p>

    <p>You meant more to me than I could ever fully explain. You still do. Not because I’m holding on blindly, but because when someone becomes a part of your heart, they don’t just disappear with time. They echo.</p>

    <p>This isn’t a confession. It’s not a plea. It’s just the truth, I cared. Deeply. I still care. Even if I no longer know how to show it without being in the way.</p>

    <p>So if you ever wonder, if even for a second whether someone once loved you without needing to be loved back...<br>
    The answer will always be yes.</p>

    <p>And somewhere out there, a quiet version of me still hopes you find all the peace in the world</p>

    <p class="signature">– Volon</p>
