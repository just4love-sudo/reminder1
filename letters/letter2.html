    <h1>A Letter I Needed to Say</h1>
    <p>
Hey,

There’s no clean way to begin this. No right sentence that makes it easier to read or easier to write.
 But I’ve carried these words for so long that keeping them inside feels like continuing the silence I already caused.

I hurt you.
I crossed a line I never should have.
And it wasn’t a one-time mistake.
It was a pattern one I refused to see while you were quietly drowning inside it.

I kept asking.
I made you feel like your body was something I needed to feel close to you.
Like your boundaries were just pauses until I could get what I wanted.
And I hate that. I hate who I was.

Because the truth is I did love you.
But I didn’t show it in a way that was safe.
I didn’t protect your comfort.
I didn’t listen when your silence was loud.

I think about that version of myself more than I wish I did.
The one who didn’t know how to handle love without control.
The one who confused closeness with access.
The one who thought wanting you was the same as deserving you.

Since then, I’ve changed not in the performative, “look how much better I am” way.
But in the small, quiet, ugly ways.
The kind that no one claps for.
The kind that just tries to make sure I never, ever become that version of me again.

There are moments I still remember vividly.
The way your tone shifted.
The way you pulled away.
The way your “no” had to come softened like you didn’t think I’d hear it if it was loud.
I think those moments will stay with me forever.

And if you never speak to me again if you’ve buried my name under better days, I understand.
You don’t owe me anything.
Not forgiveness.
Not peace.
Not even a glance in my direction.

I just want you to have the kind of life I didn’t give you:
One where your voice is enough.
Where your body is sacred, not expected.
Where love never feels like pressure.

And yes, I still love you.
Not in the way that wants you back.
Not in the way that clings.
But in the way that hopes you’re okay.
That someone out there treats you with the care I never gave.

I’ll carry this.
Not to punish myself.
But to remind myself every day of what love is supposed to look like.

I hope you're safe now.
And free.
And whole.
