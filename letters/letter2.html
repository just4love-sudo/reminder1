    <h1>A Letter I Needed to Say</h1>
    <p>
I’ve sat with this for a long time.  
Long enough to know that there’s no neat way to say it —  
no pretty apology,  
no right sentence  
that can undo what I did to you.

I crossed a line.  
And I didn’t just cross it — I stood on the other side and kept pulling.  
Kept asking.  
Kept pushing.  
Until you probably didn’t even feel like you had a choice anymore.

And the worst part is,  
I told myself I loved you.  
I thought I was close to you.  
But love doesn’t coerce.  
Love doesn’t wear someone down.  
Love doesn’t make your body feel like a debt.

I don’t know how to be forgiven for that.  
I don’t even know if I should be.  
It’s not even about forgiveness anymore —  
it’s about what I did to you.  
The harm that settled into you,  
maybe quietly, maybe loudly.  
But it’s there.  
Because of me.

And no matter how many things I try to do to “make up for it,”  
I can’t reach back and protect you from myself.  
I can’t take away the pressure,  
or the moments where you felt like your “no” had to be softened,  
or ignored,  
just to keep the peace.

I carry that.  
Not as a badge.  
Not as some poem.  
Just as weight —  
in my chest,  
in the way I talk to people now,  
in the way I make sure no one ever feels cornered again.

I don’t expect anything from you.  
Not healing.  
Not understanding.  
And especially not grace.

I just want you to know:  
I’m not proud of who I was.  
I see it now. Fully.  
And I’ve made it my quiet mission  
to never, ever let that version of me live again.

If you never think of me again, I understand.  
If you do,  
I hope you know that somewhere in the world,  
someone is trying to live differently  
because of the damage they caused you.

And maybe that doesn't fix anything.  
But it’s the truth.
